# Number-Guessing-Game
🎰🎰 This is going to be fun!

We will write a program that generates a random number and asks the players to guess it if the player's guess is higher than the actual number the program display "lower number please". Similarly if the use's guess is too low, the program prints "Higher number please".


When the user guess the correct number, the program display the number of attempts the players used to arrive at the number.

## Hints
